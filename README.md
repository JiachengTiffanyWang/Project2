### Other Chrome extension concepts I am interested in creating
* Concept 1: Let’s go Chinese female rappers
This extension will provide a list of my favorite Chinese rappers’ songs that show up on a page for the user to listen to.
* Concept 2: Memo
This extension has the function to record a memo or note from the user when browsing without opening the note app.
